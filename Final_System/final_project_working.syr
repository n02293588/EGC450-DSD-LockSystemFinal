WARNING:Xst:905 - "final_project_working.v" line 116: One or more signals are missing in the sensitivity list of always block. To enable synthesis of FPGA/CPLD hardware, XST will assume that all necessary signals are present in the sensitivity list. Please note that the result of the synthesis may differ from the initial design specification. The missing signals are:
   <lock>, <open>, <close>, <pb_state>
Module <final_project_working> is correct for synthesis.

(*) These 2 clock signal(s) are generated by combinatorial logic,

Please use the CLOCK_SIGNAL constraint to specify the clock signal(s) generated by combinatorial logic.
INFO:Xst:2169 - HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
