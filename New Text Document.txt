Final project for ECG450 - Digital Systems Design at SUNY New Paltz.

This program uses the Digilent Nexys2 microcontroller and the provided switches to create a locking/opening system (including a method locking the user out if they do not open the lock properly). The circuit constructed using Xilinx is a finite state machine.
